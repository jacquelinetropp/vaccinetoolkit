            <p>​We have made this toolkit of the most commonly asked questions we have received from patients and health care workers; and attempted to summarize answers in language that could easily be used with the general population.</p>



            <p>We do not plan to go into detail on specific health conditions, as many of those organizations have their own recommendations out or forthcoming. However, we will touch on common questions and link to specific resources.</p>



            <p> You can use this in any way you would like!

                You can “build a Vaccine Handout,” pulling questions/answers from specific areas, tailored for your patients, colleagues, family, friends, coworkers, place of worship, school, daycare, etc. </p>
